/**
 * Youhave aquired only 1 byte for performing 7 bit operation  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 = total is 256
 * because ASCII character is between 0 to 255 
 * Array with 0 and 1 is good, but binary with only 0, or almost, is even better! 
 * Originally, this is a concept designed by Chuck Norris to send so called unary messages.
 * 
 * The Encoding principle:
 * -The input message consists of ASCII characters (7-bit)
 * -The encoded output message consists of blocks of 0 and 1
 * -A block is separated from another block by a space
 * -Two consecutive blocks are used to produce a series of same value bits (only 1s or 0s):
 * 		-First block: it is always 0 or 00. If it is 0, then the series contains 1s, if not, it contains 0s
 * 		-Second block: the number of 0s in this block is the number of bits in the series
 * 
 * Write a program that takes an incoming message as input and displays as output the message encoded 
 * using Chuck Norrisâ€™ method.
 * 
 * INPUT:
 * Line 1: the message consisting of N ASCII characters 
 * 
 * OUTPUT:
 * The encoded message with 0 blocks
